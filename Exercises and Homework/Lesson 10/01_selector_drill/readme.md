# Checkerboard 


The goal of this exercise is to practice ways to select document elements with CSS selectors in various combinations. The end result should look like a checkerboard.

We have to turn alternating squares brown to finish building our board.


## Instructions 

Edit the style.css (and review the index.html)

For each of the instructions, create the desired selector and set the property:
```
    background-color: brown;
```
For each instruction, there should be ONE and ONLY ONE set of {}
